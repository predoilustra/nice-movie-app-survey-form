## About <a name = "about"></a>

The website features a form specifically designed for a fictitious movie streaming application. This form serves the purpose of gathering essential data to facilitate the conduction of a comprehensive field survey. The survey aims to establish a correlation between individuals' age groups and their specific preferences for particular movies. By acquiring such information, the study intends to gain valuable insights into the target audience's movie preferences and better understand how age influences their cinematic choices.
